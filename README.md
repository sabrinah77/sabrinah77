- 👋 Hi, I’m @sabrinah77
- 👀 I’m interested in coding a landing page for the very first time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script, html, and css. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might help these advances. And with anyone who may want to help me learn or give me advice.
- 📫 You can reach me on here if that is possible.
